<p>Lasagna, a cherished Italian classic, consists of layers of pasta sheets and a flavorful, hearty sauce. The sauce is typically crafted using ground beef or pork, paired with a medley of onions, garlic, and tomatoes. To begin, you'll prepare the meat sauce by browning the meat in a large skillet.</p>

<p>Sauté finely chopped onions and garlic until they release their aromatic flavors and become translucent. Introduce crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of Italian herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme to create a savory sauce. While the sauce simmers to enhance its taste, turn your attention to the pasta sheets and the cheese mixture.</p>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, while adding beaten eggs, salt, and pepper for a rich and creamy mixture. Now, it's time to assemble your lasagna.</p>

<p>Start with a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of pasta sheets, a spread of the cheese mixture, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella. Continue this layering process, concluding with a final layer of pasta sheets and a generous topping of mozzarella cheese.</p>

<p>Bake the lasagna until it reaches a bubbling, golden brown perfection around 30-40 minutes. Let it cool briefly before serving, and you'll relish a delightful, layered Italian masterpiece sure to satisfy your palate.</p>
